She has multiple tentacles she sweeps the floor with and lunges at you. the floor will also periodically become electrical and cause death upon contact. avoid this by dodging Mara's tentacles and grapple to the nearby walls when the floor becomes electric. Damage her by positioning yourself in front of a generator. dodge attacks trying to maintain the position, when she uses her lunge attack, dodge it and she should hit the generator. This will cause her tentacle to get stuck allowing you to slash it with your sword. Rinse and repeat until victory.</p></td>
